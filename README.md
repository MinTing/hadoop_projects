This web application works for videos with explicit source URL.
With this tool, a user can accurately select a frame in a video played through the HTML5 Video Player, easily with a sequence of "preview frames" around the selected point.
Once a frame is selected, the accurate timestamp of that frame can be read from the page.


Todo:
Enable user setting frame-rate in the input field.
Mark selected points in a progress bar.
