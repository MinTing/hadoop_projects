<![CDATA[
Regarding Access Control Headers: It is my understanding for browsers that support CORS (http://www.w3.org/TR/cors/) when using javascript XMLHttpRequests to different domain, the coorresponding response will be rejected if the Access-control-Allow-Orgin header is not set to the referring domain or '*'. For secure requests that receive a response without the Access-Control-Allow-Credentials header set will also be rejected. Also, when making a request with credentials, a wildcard domain is not accepted by the browser in the response Access-control-Allow-Orgin header. So it depends on the implementation of the ad sdk. If its web or mobile web and making XMLHttpRequests with credentials, it will not receive the ad response.

The individual ad requests I checked had it as the top item in the waterfall, but have only checked a few. The midnight start time corresponds to when the relevant ad unit had it's targeting params changed. The end time lines up with another change. I remain equal parts confused and incredulous that we're not creating cases for tasks in DFP - the updates to a case for the Impaktu order would have made all of the above obvious without having to dive through logs and work back through DFP to see what changed.

<![CDATA[
Some philosophical waxing: How is the targeting data scoped? EG, if a user is running two apps with the SDK, is that samba_id's sa_appid really "changing" each time the user switches apps? Same with partnerid, vendor id. What should the behavior be with something like carrier? Consider: - SDK gets carrier name - we'll use "T-Mobile" - sends it, server persists it - some time later, device is connected only through wifi, and carrier becomes null As of now, the naive server-side behavior would be to merge the passed data into what's persisted, then return the merged data as the new targeting params. So, we would return sa_carrier="T-Mobile". And the SDK would save that into it's local targeting params (?) and start sending that on subsequent requests? Still chewing on it, but I think we need to define the semantics of each of these fields. Most of them, I think - appid/partnerid/vendorid/idfa, connection info, device info in general - should always return their identity in the server response. The ones we might want to update based on smart logic would be things we could have derived from other data sources - sa_content, sa_age/birthdate/gender. The server wouldn't really care about the device-metadata fields unless they have changed since the last time we saw the same samba_id,sa_appid pair.

Adam: You are correct, the merging of data probably isn't the best solution for all cases. We should get together and determine how to best handle each field we collect. The most important data pieces are ids (idfa, samba_id, ad exchange ids, etc) and tying those together is important, however as you mentioned, other data points may not make sense.

This could become a blocker if Sharp complains about the CPU being used. Best to reduce it before it gets to that point. Am rewriting parts of the code so that we can set the sample rate rather than the sleep time. As currently implement the sleep time is fixed regardless of other times in the system. We should either peg sample rate which according to profiling should proportionally reduce CPU load, or we peg CPU and adapt sample rate to stay within the CPU bound.

CPU is too high on both Toshiba and Sharp. We have discussed various ways of reducing CPU, but the shortest term way to do this is to increase the frame interval. More complex ways involve refactoring the cidclient to make it easier to control CPU load, but this has turned out to be a huge time sync.

This can be used to tune the run-length thresholds using Josh's multi-match/single-lock CidServ sequence matching algorithm. We need to give this a name: CidServMMSL (?) This will also hopefully catch any brokenness in the implementation that would allow exceedingly large runs on a false positive. The old version (CidServ2RL2TF) written by Sravan exhibited run away runs reaching run lengths exceeding 100 on content not in the database. Make sure this does not happen with the new algorithm.

For a single test file, the tms getter function that maps events to timeslots rather than searching the entire prgsvcid list takes 21% less time per call calculated over roughly a 1 minute run. Overall CPU is probably only slightly affected. Cidserv was running on dave.flingo.tv: python -m cProfile -o cidserv.prof ./cidserv.py -v 6666 -n -l error >& /tmp/cidserv.out & On my laptop: cidclient --noupdate --domain=dave.flingo.tv --loglevel=trace --algo=luma_40_t50 --videofile=/home/dave/osx_dave/cid_datasets/unit_tests/cnn.mp4 --cidserv=dave.flingo.tv:6666 This might not be a fair comparison since the tms getter isn't being given enough time to build up a large cache. I will rerun the test with three videos. cnn.mp4, Pacific+Rim+Trailer+2013+1080p.mp4, and FNCHD_DirecTV_720p.mkv.

<![CDATA[
Some of the video seems to have values in the headroom and toeroom that are excluded in the BT.601 and BT.709 specifications. Luma values 0 and 255 are reserved for synchronization and the others values in headroom and toeroom (a.k.a., footroom) are meant to be left unused except to handle occasional overshoot introduced by filters. BT.601 and BT.709 colorspaces specify that luma should remain in the range [16,235], and chroma values should remain in the range [16,240]. The average luma value for a frame can differ by as much as 18. This could be due to colorspace changes. Our current quantizer partitions all luma values in [16,240] evenly across the histogram buckets, and then maps every luma value in the range [241,255] into the highest bucket, and maps every luma value in the range [0,16] into the lowest bucket in the histogram. Therefore the top and bottom buckets are wider than the other buckets. If there are a significant number of pixels with luma values in [1,15] or in [236,255] then we could switch color spaces or we could introduce an additional fingerprint that uses uniform quantization across the entire range [1,254] omitting only 0 and 255 since they are used only for synchronization. The purpose of this ticket is to run a few tests on datasets that we already have that have luma values in the disallowed ranges and seeing if match rate improves for such affected videos by employing quantization that is uniformly partitioned across [1,254]. --Dave

This is a blocker, since such a data set is necessary before any verification or tuning using a completely repeatable data set is possible. One possibility is to run a CIDClient on the Toshiba that dumps fingerprints to a file. Run HDMI out of DirecTV or Dish into an HDMI splitter. From the splitter, one cable goes to the decklink and the other to the Toshiba. Flip through a number of HD channels capturing channel changes and commercials to a file while also generating fingerprints from the TV. Take the fingerprints dumped from the CIDClient and use the production snapshotting tool to dump the subset of the fingerprint database relevant to the data set. Annotate the Decklink-captured video. Presumably the annotations are output to a subtitle (.srt) file. Annotations should include marking the beginning and ending of each commercial and providing some unique ID to each commercial. The IDs only need to be unique within the scope of the tests and may serve to determine how quickly the algorithm handles transitions: show to commercial, commercial to commercial, and commercial to show. Try to synchronize the Decklink-captured video to the timestamps in the fingerprint stream from the TV. Once the appropriate offsets have been determined, annotate the fingerprint dump with the content IDs in the .srt annotation file. Maybe repeat the entire process to create a second data set using SD channels or a mix of HD and SD.

The periodic query object should send at a regular interval perhaps with some small amount of randomization to prevent synchronization of arrivals on the backend resulting periodic load spikes. The query object sends whatever fingerprints have been generated since the last batch. Fingerprinting continues in the fingerprinting thread even as the query is being handled in cidserv. This decouples network behavior from fingerprint behavior allowing us to avoid most impact of network delay on fingerprint performance, and to decouple CPU and network load.

The periodic query object should send at a regular interval perhaps with some small amount of randomization to prevent synchronization of arrivals on the backend resulting periodic load spikes.&nbsp; <br /> <br /> The query object sends whatever fingerprints have been generated since the last batch.&nbsp; Fingerprinting continues in the fingerprinting thread even as the query is being handled in cidserv.&nbsp; This decouples network behavior from fingerprint behavior allowing us to avoid most impact of network delay on fingerprint performance, and to decouple CPU and network load.<br />

<![CDATA[
d now, which is a result of enforcing a time filter even when locked.. So I'll have to work on that some more. Detecting pause also works quite well, most of the time.. however sometimes the screen that I'm paused on has zero hits to the content, so it loses lock.. not much I can do about that since there's no matches.. I could detect that the screen is sending the same FP (like we would do on the client), but that's not good because if there's no matches, they could have gone to some static menu screen and we'd want to drop lock anyways. so overall, I think it's a good improvement on several factors. I just need to verify that EG is still working and I'll push this live. Here are some of the things I changed: upped the 'nearly lockable' threshold from 5 to 6, which eliminated most of the spurious matches to junk i mentioned yesterday. That enables us to lock onto the new channel much quicker because we don't have to wait for the spurious 'nearly lockables' to go away before declaring lock. I modified the time filter to accept a non-symmetrical window - that is, you can specify the + and - amounts around the target time separately. I eliminated a bug where I was setting the 'last seen' timestamp for a run regardless of whether it hit the time filter or was a timestamp collision or whatnot.. This was causing certain runs to be carried forward longer than they should, causing excess drag For confirming lock, I now require the hit to pass a sliding time filter, but instead of using the usual window, I require it to be with -.75 seconds to + 4.5.. This should help eliminate drag of EG when changing during the commercial. This needs to be confirmed that it works properly (in queue for Tapan, it failed yesterday) (that's for EG) For BC, to confirm lock i now require it to pass a time filter, but this time the window is +- 6*1.5 (1.5 being the normal time filter window). This reduces spurious drag when changing from a lock to a channel we don't fingerprint, and is loose enough that it doesn't seem to cause us to drop lock under normal circumstances. It does not handle FFwd or RW as well though, so I may increase the size of the window further. When a lockable, is not the main lock (ie during a commercial scenario), i extend the 'last seen' in the same way I extend it for the locked CID - this fixed a false positive issue where you change the channel in the middle of a commercial to a non-fp channel.. What was happening, was that the lockables would all expire, and the remaining 'lock' (which was to a random show that had that commercial) would remain because it's expiry was extended, and we'd declare false positive lock on that. ^^^ that was a big issue IMO, so I'm glad to have eliminated that (at least I haven't been able to reproduce it anymore) I set the 'last seen' even if we hit a TS collision, which allows us to keep lock (or commercial flag) even during static screens in commercials. (that is only set if it passes the expanded time filter as we do for a locked run) I disabled the not_count stuff I also don't drop lock in the middle of a batch. I wait until the end of processing all the FP in the batch and drop lock if appropirate. Then I look to see if there are any lockables remaining, and select the 'best one' and declare lock on the new one. That reduces drag time when switching between content, and also helps us maintain lock even if the expiry was passed, provided we at least see a hit during the batch. fixed a bug where the suppressed state (during a commercial) was getting set incorrectly, forcing us to re-aquire lock after the state was unsuppressed. That allows us to lock on much faster in those cases where we transition out of a commercial That's about "it"! pretty major upgrade actually

I also have gotten rid of some false positives that occurred when you change channel in the middle of a commercial to a channel we don't fingerprint.. looking pretty good!<br /> However, i sometimes lose lock during FFwd now, which is a result of enforcing a time filter even when locked.. So I'll have to work on that some more.<br /> <br /> Detecting pause also works quite well, most of the time.. however sometimes the screen that I'm paused on has zero hits to the content, so it loses lock.. not much I can do about that since there's no matches.. I could detect that the screen is sending the same FP (like we would do on the client), but that's not good because if there's no matches, they could have gone to some static menu screen and we'd want to drop lock anyways.<br /> so overall, I think it's a good improvement on several factors. I just need to verify that EG is still working and I'll push this live.<br /> <br /> Here are some of the things I changed:<br /> <br /> upped the 'nearly lockable' threshold from 5 to 6, which eliminated most of the spurious matches to junk i mentioned yesterday. That enables us to lock onto the new channel much quicker because we don't have to wait for the spurious 'nearly lockables' to go away before declaring lock.<br /> <br /> I modified the time filter to accept a non-symmetrical window - that is, you can specify the + and - amounts around the target time separately. <br /> <br /> I eliminated a bug where I was setting the 'last seen' timestamp for a run regardless of whether it hit the time filter or was a timestamp collision or whatnot.. This was causing certain runs to be carried forward longer than they should, causing excess drag<br /> <br /> For confirming lock, I now require the hit to pass a sliding time filter, but instead of using the usual window, I require it to be with -.75 seconds to + 4.5.. This should help eliminate drag of EG when changing during the commercial. This needs to be confirmed that it works properly (in queue for Tapan, it failed yesterday)<br /> (that's for EG)<br /> <br /> For BC, to confirm lock i now require it to pass a time filter, but this time the window is +- 6*1.5 (1.5 being the normal time filter window). This reduces spurious drag when changing from a lock to a channel we don't fingerprint, and is loose enough that it doesn't seem to cause us to drop lock under normal circumstances. It does not handle FFwd or RW as well though, so I may increase the size of the window further.<br /> <br /> When a lockable, is not the main lock (ie during a commercial scenario), i extend the 'last seen' in the same way I extend it for the locked CID - this fixed a false positive issue where you change the channel in the middle of a commercial to a non-fp channel.. What was happening, was that the lockables would all expire, and the remaining 'lock' (which was to a random show that had that commercial) would remain because it's expiry was extended, and we'd declare false positive lock on that.<br /> <br /> ^^^ that was a big issue IMO, so I'm glad to have eliminated that (at least I haven't been able to reproduce it anymore)<br /> <br /> I set the 'last seen' even if we hit a TS collision, which allows us to keep lock (or commercial flag) even during static screens in commercials.<br /> (that is only set if it passes the expanded time filter as we do for a locked run)<br /> <br /> I disabled the not_count stuff<br /> <br /> I also don't drop lock in the middle of a batch. I wait until the end of processing all the FP in the batch and drop lock if appropirate. Then I look to see if there are any lockables remaining, and select the 'best one' and declare lock on the new one. That reduces drag time when switching between content, and also helps us maintain lock even if the expiry was passed, provided we at least see a hit during the batch.<br /> fixed a bug where the suppressed state (during a commercial) was getting set incorrectly, forcing us to re-aquire lock after the state was unsuppressed. That allows us to lock on much faster in those cases where we transition out of a commercial<br /> <br /> That's about &quot;it&quot;!<br /> <br /> pretty major upgrade actually

<![CDATA[
When passing a videofile to one of these fp-generating systems, non-standard resolutions sometimes are refused. While we wouldn't expect the fingerprints from a non-standard resolution to match some other non-standard or even a standard resolution, we should still be able to generate fingerprints from that non-standard video, and they should match the fingerprints generated by any other process for a video of that same Aspect Ratio. So rather than barfing on an unexpected res, apply some dynamic roi generation that is consistent at least between other videos of the same aspect ratio.

<![CDATA[
The install script for cidserv is failing because it includes the install-worker script, which is broken. It's missing a perms set for the newly created /home/ubuntu/worker-repos directory, but beyond that, it's still out of date. The checkout still refers to the fs repository instead of gs. And it also hasn't been updated to point to kiln. This is blocking my installs on the new cidservs. The failed checkout causes the install script to abort without doing the critical installs that follow it in the script (mongo, memcached, etc). In seeing this, I decided to look at the current host set for the worker-repo/master on prod cidservs, and they haven't been updated to kiln yet. So sims wont work right now either. Will create separate ticket for this.

<![CDATA[
I'd like to clean up the demos. For legacy reasons, the demos are being re-inserted into the broadcast fingerprint database every few hours. Now that we have evergreen, the demos belong there. The CNN demo is taking 8-18 seconds to ID, which is way to high, and causes alerts go go out. The rest seem fine though. They would perform much better if they lived in evergreen. It's time to migrate these all into evergreen and deprecate the process that keeps re-inserting these into the broadcast database, since they really don't belong mixed in there. Plus, this gives us the ability to use the evergreen asset management system. Before I do this, can we go through all the demo's being inserted, and get rid of any that are not needed? Below is the list of files we insert every couple hours. Only 17 of these are actually being verified in the automatic verification system - see those results here http://10.1.0.102:8080/headend/DD00000/verification_results . Please let me know which of these you want to keep. -Josh 10.ces.demo.com.dishonored.fpt.gz 11.ces.demo.com.toshibasatellite.fpt.gz 11.StorageWarsRelated1-DuckDynastyS02E13.EP015312220028.fpt.gz 12.ces.demo.com.hitman.fpt.gz 12.DanceMomsRelated1-ProjectRunwayS10E05.EP007055290170.fpt.gz 13.ces.demo.com.totalrecall.fpt.gz 13.MankindRelated1-AmericanPickersS03E06.EP012124070040.fpt.gz 14.ces.demo.com.surface.fpt.gz 14.NewGirlRelated1-TheMindyProjectS01E09.EP015680280008.fpt.gz 15.ces.demo.com.battleroyale.fpt.gz 15.XfactorRelated1-AmericanIdolS10E29.EP005520800366.fpt.gz 16.ces.demo.com.ted.fpt.gz 16.ShowtimeRelated1-HouseofLiesPromoLogoS01E12.EP014812180012.fpt.gz 17.ces.demo.com.windowsphone.fpt.gz 17.StorageWarsRelated2-ShippingWarsS02E15.EP015067650025.fpt.gz 18.ces.demo.com.tivo.fpt.gz 18.DanceMomsRelated2-DesperateHousewivesS08E03.EP006723180174.fpt.gz 19.ces.demo.com.hpenvy23.fpt.gz 19.MankindRelated2-PawnStarsS06E09.EP011594940211.fpt.gz 1.ces.demo.com.halo4.fpt.gz 1.ces.icom.bestbuymontage.fpt.gz 2013+Ford+Fusion+-+Commercial+1080p.mp4.a7d44eb615f21f4e130dbd7c4bf4d0fee06c123f.fpt.gz 20.ces.demo.com.residentevil6.fpt.gz 20.NewGirlRelated2-ParenthoodS04E11.EP011541630064.fpt.gz 21.ces.demo.com.toshibasatultra.fpt.gz 21.XfactorRelated2-GleeS04E10.EP011413890079.fpt.gz 22.ces.demo.com.lgoptimusg.fpt.gz 22.ShowtimeRelated2.DexterS07E10.EP008597950084.fpt.gz 23.ces.demo.com.windows8birds.fpt.gz 23.StorageWarsRelated3-StorageWarsTexasS02E15.EP014162810031.fpt.gz 24.DanceMomsRelated3-TheClientListS01E09.EP015201970009.fpt.gz 25.MankindRelated3-AmericanRestorationS02E41.EP013286140089.fpt.gz 26.NewGirlRelated3-RaisingHopeS03E10.EP012792180055.fpt.gz 27.XfactorRelated3-SYTYCDS09E12.EP007517000216.fpt.gz 28.ShowtimeRelated3-BorgiasS02E03.EP013918690013.fpt.gz 29.StorageWarsRelated4-DogTheBountyHunter.EP006750820302.fpt.gz 2.ces.demo.com.galaxynote.fpt.gz 2.ces.icom.littlecaesars.fpt.gz 30.DanceMomsRelated4-ArmyWivesS6E6.EP009249690093.fpt.gz 31.MankindRelated4-CajunPawnStarsS02E37.EP015092520051.fpt.gz 32.NewGirlRelated4-BenAndKateS01E10.EP015679990010.fpt.gz 33.XfactorRelated4-TheVoiceS03E09.EP013657560045.fpt.gz 34.ShowtimeRelated4-WeedsS08E10.EP007593950106.fpt.gz 36.DanceMomsRelated5-DropDeadDivaS04E09.EP011587370052.fpt.gz 37.MankindRelated5-AxMenS05E20.EP010237320114.fpt.gz 39.XfactorRelated5-AmericasGotTalentS07E16.EP008298780178.fpt.gz 3.AandE-Storage_Wars_Hobo.EP013413450052.fpt.gz 3.ces.demo.com.toshibaultra.fpt.gz 3.ces.icom.fifa.fpt.gz 40.ShowtimeRelated5-CalifornicationS05E11.EP009428360061.fpt.gz 41.FringeRelated-BonesS08E08.EP007542010193.fpt.gz 42.FringeRelated-TheMentalistS05E08.EP010587140107.fpt.gz 43.FringeRelated-TouchS01E12.EP014192370011.fpt.gz 44.FringeRelated-ArrowS01E08.EP007128720123.fpt.gz 45.FringeRelated-BurnNoticeS06E08.EP009248440093.fpt.gz 49.XFACTOR_S02E24.EP013734580061.fpt.gz 4.ces.demo.com.assassinscreed.fpt.gz 4.ces.icom.breathright.fpt.gz 4.Lifetime-Dance_Moms_226_Nationals.EP014266580041.fpt.gz 5.ces.demo.com.nookhd.fpt.gz 5.ces.icom.tylerperry.fpt.gz 5.History-Mankind_101_Inventors.EP016164960001.fpt.gz 6.ces.demo.com.madden13.fpt.gz 6.ces.icom.re6.fpt.gz 6.Fox-NewGirlS02E11.EP014192030033.fpt.gz 7.ces.demo.com.nikon1.fpt.gz 7.Fox-FringeS05E09.EP010591030103.fpt.gz 8.ces.demo.com.nba2k13.fpt.gz 8.ShowtimeHomelandS02E12.EP014661710026.fpt.gz 9.ces.demo.com.prometheus.fpt.gz BEST_1.mkv.a7d44eb615f21f4e130dbd7c4bf4d0fee06c123f.fpt.gz cnbc.mp4.a7d44eb615f21f4e130dbd7c4bf4d0fee06c123f.fpt.gz cnn.mp4.a7d44eb615f21f4e130dbd7c4bf4d0fee06c123f.fpt.gz CNN.ts.a7d44eb615f21f4e130dbd7c4bf4d0fee06c123f.fpt.gz Demo1.mkv.a7d44eb615f21f4e130dbd7c4bf4d0fee06c123f.fpt.gz DREAM_1.mkv.a7d44eb615f21f4e130dbd7c4bf4d0fee06c123f.fpt.gz ESPN.ts.a7d44eb615f21f4e130dbd7c4bf4d0fee06c123f.fpt.gz FBN.ts.a7d44eb615f21f4e130dbd7c4bf4d0fee06c123f.fpt.gz FNC.ts.a7d44eb615f21f4e130dbd7c4bf4d0fee06c123f.fpt.gz KKPX.ts.a7d44eb615f21f4e130dbd7c4bf4d0fee06c123f.fpt.gz mlb.mp4.a7d44eb615f21f4e130dbd7c4bf4d0fee06c123f.fpt.gz nfl.mp4.a7d44eb615f21f4e130dbd7c4bf4d0fee06c123f.fpt.gz NFL.ts.a7d44eb615f21f4e130dbd7c4bf4d0fee06c123f.fpt.gz Pacific+Rim+Trailer+2013+1080p.mp4.a7d44eb615f21f4e130dbd7c4bf4d0fee06c123f.fpt.gz SPEED.ts.a7d44eb615f21f4e130dbd7c4bf4d0fee06c123f.fpt.gz SPIKE.ts.a7d44eb615f21f4e130dbd7c4bf4d0fee06c123f.fpt.gz storage.wars.s02e30.720p.hdtv.x264-momentum.encoded.mkv.a7d44eb615f21f4e130dbd7c4bf4d0fee06c123f.fpt.gz TNT.ts.a7d44eb615f21f4e130dbd7c4bf4d0fee06c123f.fpt.gz USA.ts.a7d44eb615f21f4e130dbd7c4bf4d0fee06c123f.fpt.gz XFACT_1.mkv.a7d44eb615f21f4e130dbd7c4bf4d0fee06c123f.fpt.gz XFACT_2.mkv.a7d44eb615f21f4e130dbd7c4bf4d0fee06c123f.fpt.gz

The tuner module should check the instance of tee_device.py that is running for that tuner, and ensure that it is connected to the appropriate multicast feed, to ensure that there wasn't some orphaned tee_device from an earlier run that is feeding the wrong channel.

The TV-based verification currently only runs against a single TV at a time. It would be awesome to have it be able to tune a single DTV recvr, output through a HDMI splitter into multiple TVs of various brands, and then collect the cidclient results from each as they processed that same input stream. We'd need more TVs and DTV recvrs to have this running full time, but we should work towards that.

Changing the filenames from the current structure could mean we would need to change some already ingested files, but I think we could actually get away with leaving the existing as is, and only applying the new filename method to content moving forwards.

Did some digging into this - unfortunately there doesn't appear to be a way to directly tune the SD version of a channel using the SHEF api - or even the remote itself. I did come up with a work around though. If you go into the Preferences, you can select 'hide hd channels', after which the tuner will go to the SD version instead. This essentially puts the receiver in SD mode for any channel that has an SD version. I think if you directly tune a channel that has no SD version, it might still tune the HD channel, but I'm not sure at this moment. Another option would be to (manually?) set a flag against the lineup in zookeeper, and then the tuner could send a channel up command after tuning the HD version, which gets you to the SD. But that would be annoying. This is sufficient for the time being.

I look up 30000 random keys in redis and eliminate those that map onto Ceton tuners:
 
  
 
 ubuntu@flingo2:PRODUCTION:~$ redis-cli -r 30000   randomkey  | grep -v ure | grep cidserv_guid | grep -v re | grep -v :e
 
 cidserv_guid:21c32aba48f86f8360c88b3f51550737fbc5b351
 
 cidserv_guid:d5df3092d05128ec0667d8c4852fc5d190e5193c
 
 cidserv_guid:19e9be96050edd2fa07c68f79452273238bfbbf2
 
 ubuntu@flingo2:PRODUCTION:~$ 
 
  
 
 I lookup a much smaller random subset without excluding the Ceton tuners.
 
  
 
 
 ubuntu@flingo2:PRODUCTION:~$ redis-cli -r 30   randomkey  | grep cidserv_guid 
 
 cidserv_guid:ure1b3c7cd
 
 cidserv_guid:ure1c4ea34
 
 cidserv_guid:ure5f28a32
 
 cidserv_guid:ure42e3ef1
 
 cidserv_guid:ure1f0d01d
 
 cidserv_guid:e1002900d3
 
 cidserv_guid:ure1f161ed
 
 cidserv_guid:ure50811ac
 
 cidserv_guid:ure5892266
 
 cidserv_guid:ure55620df
 
 cidserv_guid:ure7e049ba
 
 cidserv_guid:ure4800a2d
 
 cidserv_guid:re98478fa2
 
  
 
 It seems 30-40% of all keys in redis are due to ceton tuners.
 
  
 
 These guids look much different than those generated by cidclients.  The guids appearing in these keys are set in ceton.py:
 
  
 
 
         self.cidclient_guid = host +"_"+ str(self.instance_id) + "_" + str(self.card_id)
 
         self.cidclient_guid = self.cidclient_guid[-10:]
 
  
 
 These guids are ending up in redis via mdb.services.cid (see gs/mdb/services/cid.py) in either set_device_cidserv or get_device_cidserv. get_device_cidserv is called from mdb.services.cid.content_id(guid) as well as other places.  mdb.services.cid.content_id is called from appserv/views/syncapps.py in the function http://samba.tv/syncapps/content_id?guid=BLAH and possibly other places.
 
  
 
 Are the ceton cards generating excessive numbers of guids?

Subject: Re: FogBugz (Case 338) Content_id - Many many many capture guids ending up in redis

This is by design. During verification, the guid gets set as following -
 and is changed in between verification events so that we can extract the
 cidserv log for that guid using log_getter for debugging. That requires
 that each guid be unique.
 cet.cidclient_guid_counter += 1
 guid_str = hostname +"_"+ str(cet.instance_id) + "_" + str(cet.card_id) +
 str(time.time())
 cet.cidclient_guid = hostname +
 hashlib.sha1(guid_str).hexdigest()[-6:]
 
 # cet.cidclient_guid = hashlib.sha1("%d%s" %
 (cet.cidclient_guid_counter , cet.cidclient_guid)).hexdigest()
 
 # cet.cidclient_guid = "%02d%s" % (cet.cidclient_guid_counter ,
 cet.cidclient_guid[2:])
 
 # cet.cidclient_guid = "%04d%s" % (cet.cidclient_guid_counter ,
 cet.cidclient_guid[4:])
 
 cet.cidclient_guid = cet.cidclient_guid[-10:]

<![CDATA[
The cache replacement on redis is LRU once it reaches a size.  As we ramp up the number of cidclients, I expect the tuner-created GUIDs to constitute a relatively small subset of the database.
 
 We could reduce them if there ever is a problem by adding an argument up through the APIs being called by the tuner test subsystem or by namespacing the GUIDs (e.g., starting the GUID with a short prefix).  An argument could specify a short TTL or could specify "no cache."  Similarly, get_device_cidserv could choose to not cache or use a small TTL for tuner-namespaced GUIDs.
 
 For now I am dropping the priority.

Need to build a real-world test apparatus for running thousands of simulated 'cidclients' against a cidserv. Take a fully-loaded cidserv (with 3-days of content + live channels coming in), then launch thousands of cidclients from external to the colo, and see how the server handles it, as well as the front end router, content apis, etc. Cidclients could be simulated if we can launch them against fingerprint files instead of video files, so we don't have to decode the video K thousands of times in parallel. Perhaps throw in random junk fingerprints from time to time as well to simulate noise.

Did a bunch of research and some preliminary testing to support this. Going to use logstache as the platform for handling the collection of the fingerprint records. Built a test integration into capserv that will send the memcached writes as they come in. These will get collected into a logstache server, that will layer them into, what are essentially, db journals. If necessary, we may shard the fingerprint writes across 2 logstache servers, but that may not be important. On a single-core VM running on my laptop, I was able to process between 4-6000 writes per second. Based on calculations using a test capture box with 8 channels, feeding my Dev instance, I estimate that a full 140 channels will be approximately 4k per second. (~12k writes per minute for 8 channels). In terms of space, based on the 8 channels, scaling up to 140 channels by 3 days, would consume about 35 gigs of disk space for the fp logs, however, as the database gets more 'full', the size of each write will increase due to each write including any possible collisions, so consider this space estimate low. These fp write files are split up into logs minute-by-minute, so in order for a fresh memcached to spin up, it will first start walking through the fp log file, starting from 3 days ago. Then, once it gets to current, it will attach to the live set of servers and start getting live fingerprints from the cluster. #### The pathway for how we spin up a new server that uses a different version of the fingerprint is going to be a little more complicated, and will need some additional thought on the best way to handle it. First, lets assume that we can get capture_ffmpeg to generate both types of fingerprints, and send them, either to the same capserv, or a different one. If we have it send the fingerprints to the same capserv, then we can simply have that capserv write those fingerprints to the logstache server (either the same one, or a different one), with those writes appropriately labelled with the fingerprint hash. In this case, the logs will be simply of the generated fingerprints themselves, rather than a representation of the DB writes. Therefore, when spinning up a memcached that will house these fingerprints, we will have to perform a read-modify-write on each insert, rather than the more simple writes that we can do with the primary fingerprint pathway discussed above. We could consider pre-processing these first, so that the read-modify-write calculation only has to be done once. Alternatively, if we spin up enough capserv/cidservs as part of the 'new' cluster to support all the channels (2 should be sufficient), and are able to direct the secondary fingerprint stream to those, we could build the read-modify-write stack a-la the primary pathway, and avoid having to pay this cost later when spinning up. We need to investigate this further.

Need to do further benchmarking and optimization of cidserv. Here are the results from a run mattb performed: ###### I've done some benchmarking on cidserv - estimating with the four servers we have, we could do around 20k concurrent TVs. This is about 200 or so per process. TVs that are sending random fingerprints (stuff we don't capture, maybe a significant portion of traffic) are lighter-weight than tvs that are matching something - by maybe half. Also profiled this: By cumulative time: http://git.flingo.tv/pb/view/1cb3d638 By module: http://git.flingo.tv/pb/view/59735248 Fairly easy to run this yourself if you're interested - just: $ python -m cProfile -o cidserv.prof ./cidserv.py -v 6666 -n -l error Run your tests, and then kill the cidserv - then pass the cidserv.prof file through pstats (tools/prof/print_prof.py). Nothing in particular sticks out - maybe logging could be optimized, even though I had it turned off, everything except the actual write to the log file is happening and there is a crap ton of logging in the thing right now. I'll do some more detailed testing on prod once these gen_fingerprints jobs finish. I also put some throttling into the cidserv - it holds off returning the response if a particular search took longer than 100ms (the process is overloaded) which slows down the query rate and keeps the rpc response time reasonable (within a couple hundred ms). m

Ran 12 hours of testing, and the results look good, but there is room for improvement in commercial detection: TOTAL STATS NUM TESTS    10765 Total Successes   8689 Avg Success Time   1.28140510991 Total Fails 408 FP Count  331 FN Count    77 Commercial Count 1668 Slow Count 135 There were still 329 'False Positives' that ideally would be flagged as commercials. While this is a vast improvement (and would be mitigated by the client passing into the commercial break from the actual content), I think we can do better. If someone tunes in during a commercial break, there is still a possiblity that we might ID the wrong show (about 16% of the time if you tune straight to commercial according to this) So, lets investigate and see if we can do better! Furthermore, lets try breaking the commercials into categories like news/sports/promo/intro categories.

It doesn't work too well currently, we seem to be missing a lot of tms for some reason, probably an issue with the caching. Need to investigate furth Caching the seriesID, genres, and progTypes, and counting them up. If all runs are from the same seriesId, it will lock on type 'Intro'.

Currently, I'm not examining a FP match (when locked) unless there is at least 2 hits to the same ID in a batch. When unlocked, I pass every match in the stack to add_query_result. We could take this further, and basically ignore all matches to a CID until you get N, where N is the 'nearly lockable' threshold, since otherwise there's no way it could build a run with less FP. We'd need to cache the FP on the server until it crossed the threshold, so there might be some memory cost. And we'd need to know when to clear the cached FP, so maintaining the cache might have some cost as well.

tracked down the issue logic bug in the code we added this morning to speed up transition from previous lock to new lock so when we let a new lock override even if it's shorter.. we do it if it started after the last time we saw the previous id.. or we let it override if the new match is evergreen but we do that irrespective of whether the previous match is evergreen not sure that's exactly what we want.. probably ok, but not something we considered.. will have to think about that shouldnt be a problem as long as we dont have duplicates or similar versions of the same commercial but if we have 2 commercials that have the same ending, you would get the correct one matching first, but then when you got to the end, it would pretty much always jump to the second commercial.. so perhaps if we are going from EG to EG, then we must require that it passes the normal rule for not overlapping (ie last hit from previous ID is before start of new run )

Yeah, migrating everything off the bad node. Definitely a disk space thing. Blithely deleted all kinds of host-role assignments - no doubt IRL it would have been data loss. But good way of figuring out where everything lives in the management UI. Bringing services back up now. Already a bunch of nodes have warnings about the free space on their log partitions - not sure whether I should have them use their instance-store block devices, or if there's some log rotation thing that should be configured.

Kind of an open-ended case - not entirely sure where this is going to lead. First up, start acking the messages that I retrieve locally, verify that it looks as expected, generate some more logs, rinse/lather/repeat. What I see will determine the next steps. Best-case, start generating some cool-looking output data from the logs. HDFS needs to be set up again, but that will likely not be part of this case, and I'll likely leave that for Monday - feeding the single-TV data into it will be kind of meaningless (never hitting file-rotation thresholds, etc) - but it's possible that the single-tv logs will be trivially multiplicable into a more interesting (fake) dataset.

Hmmm. Acked messages until exhausted to make sure I wasn't working with any demo data (all of this is interactive). Have had the TV on maybe 20 mins now, but no new events. A couple other things. One, all of the events were of durationWidgetTemp - and they all report the same time-since-powerOn. Combined with local_time_ms field stuck at 224 and a remote IP that seems to be either loopback or from samsung's IP block, and not entirely sure that I've seen any records that weren't demo data. Being patient, switched from ESPN to Cleveland show to... NCIS? CSI? something. Something that should get ACRed tho.

 Hi Tom,
 
 
 
 We are not seeing new events in the RabbitMQ from our TV. Adam (cc'd) can
 provide more specific details. Can the two of you work together to get
 this up and working?

 Hi Tom - can you give me a call at 704-981-1235 when you have the

 Hi Tom,
 
 
 
 We are not seeing new events in the RabbitMQ from our TV. Adam (cc'd) can
 provide more specific details. Can the two of you work together to get
 this up and working?
 
 
 
 Thanks,
 
 Chris

 Hi Chris & Adam,
 
 
 
 This is a heads up, we will deploy App Server to publish with a new
 addition RabbitMQ to handle more traffic, load, connections…
 
 Also , the queues have been distributed to different RabbitMQ servers.
 
 Adam , I will call you right after this email, when you are ready I will
 deploy this changes for us synchronize testing together.

 We're seeing some sample datapoints coming through on those queues. What
 time today should we be prepared to get the full scale of events?

 Ok - both of these are fine, I'll keep the FlingoQ & other events

 What time tomorrow should I plan to roll out the change to start

These have pid as a filename fragment. Will need to do something along the lines of: - go through all target servers - record filenames seen & stat() info - mtime, size - wait - go back through target servers. If mtime & size haven't changed, assume file is no longer being written to, and ship the logfile. Fairly fragile. If a server isn't getting any traffic, I will incorrectly assume the file is no longer being written to. To avoid this, I might also check that some files *have* changed (or appeared) before treating unchanged logfiles as ready-for-consumption. Having this work reliably would involve the application code having an explicit handler for old filenames, but since it's gunicorn rotating the processes after hitting max requests, that wouldn't be reliable. Open question right now of where the state for previous-iteration polling will live. Simple answer would be in-memory on a long-running process, but not happy with that - won't be easy to introspect.

This is a cron.d job that will run on an instance that periodically syncs Fogbugz and Asana. The high-level process works as follows: 1. PM or an engineer creates a task in Asana. 2. If the task is sufficiently specific to be actionable, the engineer or PM enters the magic phrase "create ticket" in the description or in a comment. 3. A cron job scans Asana tasks for "create ticket" and when found bidirectionally links them. Similarly if a task is modified in fogbugz then its state should be loosely synchronized with asana.

When a PM/developer puts "create ticket" anywhere in a task's "notes", create a FogBugz ticket with the same title and description. If the task has been assigned in Asana then it should be assigned to the same user in FogBugz. Also in the FogBugz ticket's description include a hyperlink back to the Asana task. This should be integrated with case 324. After this has been done, the tasks should be bidirectionally linked. This process needs to be idempotent. If it runs multiple times and is successful one or more times, the result should be the same. Do not add multiple bidirectional links. Always check if one already exists. If an asana ticket is found with a hyperlink, make sure the FogBugz ticket has a reverse link, and vice versa for FogBugz. It needs to "repair" itself if either the Asana or FogBugz update fails.

<![CDATA[
The creation of a FogBugz ticket with a link back to Asana should be an atomic step.  Hopefully FogBugz and Asana are not idiotic tools and thus a call to add a task is atomic.  Thus if a ticket or task fails to be added then it is never added part way (e.g., with the title but without the description). 
 
 If "add ticket to FogBugz" is atomic then when we "add ticket to FogBugz" in response to a ticket added in Asana we can include the link back to Asana.  Adding to FogBugz might fail, but if it succeeds then the link back to Asana will exist.
 
 If "add ticket to Fogbugz" is atomic then we can use the hyperlink as the identifying link that ties the FogBugz task to the Asana task.  If "add task to Asana" is similarly atomic, then when we create an Asana task in response to creation of a FogBugz ticket then link from Asana to FogBugz can analogously become the identifying link that ties the FogBugz ticket to the Asana task.
 
 The first created link: the one from FogBugz to Asana or the one from Asana to FogBugz becomes the identifying link that ties two tasks together. As long as a link exists in one direction or the other, the two tasks are considered identical.
 
 If every a ticket or task is found with a one-directional identifying link then an identifying link should be added in the reverse direction.
 
 Once a ticket and a task are tied together, if either changes we can propagate the changes to the other. Title can change, description can change, etc.  Any field for which there exists an equivalent field in other tool can change and yet the task/ticket are considered the same and the changes are propagated so long as a link exists in one direction or other.
 
 However, we don't need to worry about propagating all applicable changes until a later ticket (see case 328).

An "equivalency link" must be distinguishable from other types of links.  Just because a link exists between a task and a ticket does not mean they should be identified as a single equivalent ticket/task.

After some discussion, I think for now we should only create equivalent Asana tasks if the magic phrase "create ticket" appears in the description or a comment of the FogBugz ticket.  Thus both Asana and FogBugz would require the "create ticket" magic phrase for Fogana to automatically create a bidirectionally equivalency hyperlinked ticket/task in the other.

I hope that there is a way to query Asana and FogBugz for recent changes (e.g., everything since the last several executions of the script). If there is a difference between an Asana task and a FogBugz ticket for any field that can reasonably be mapped then the more recent change should be propagated to the other system. Therefore, if I change something in Asana then within a few minutes the same change appears in FogBugz and vice versa. If both Asana and FogBugz have been changed since the last execution of the script then the later one wins. Example: if I close a ticket in FogBugz then it should close in Asana. If I reassign a ticket in FogBugz then the corresponding Asana task should be reassigned. The script must have a mapping between user IDs for FogBugz and Asana. If no corresponding user is known between Asana and FogBugz then this should be logged (see case 327).

We need a name for the script you are creating to sync FogBugz and Asana. For now I will call it "Fogana."
 
 "Idempotence" means that if an operation is run multiple times and it succeeds at least once (i.e., twice, three times, etc.), the system ends up in the same state. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idempotent and search for "Computer science meaning".
 
 "Error correction" refers to correcting errors that occur during transmission over a noisy channel (or performing operations on a system where partial failure may occur). http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Error_detection_and_correction
 
 "Eventual consistency" means that if the same query is made to an item (e.g., either the Asana task and its equivalent FogBugz task) that they will eventually return the same value. See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eventual_consistency
 
 "Atomicity" refers to a sequence of operations that either all occur or none do.   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomicity_(database_systems)
 Updating both FogBugz and Asana cannot achieve "atomicity".  They cannot be atomic because a user may update one manually without updating the other.  We want humans to update only one and Fogana will then propagate the changes.  Furthermore, when Fogana adds a ticket to Asana and FogBugz, creation of one task/ticket must complete in order to get a hyperlink to put in the other.  As a result Fogana cannot achieve atomic updates of FogBugz and Asana.  In the absence of atomicity we accept that only eventual consistency is possible.
 
 Fogana should be idempotent, perform error correction, and achieve eventual consistency.
 
 A good way to test idempotence is to create a test script that repeats operations:
 
 
 Create ticket/task in Asana with the "create ticket" magic phrase.
 
 Run the Fogana script.
 
 Run the Fogana script again.
 
 confirm that exactly one equivalent task is created in FogBugz and is linked to Asana.
 
 
 Repeat the same thing for FogBugz to Asana.
 
 To test error correction, the test script should do the following:
 
 
 Creates ticket/task that is broken in some way.
 
 Run the Fogana script.
 
 Once the Fogana script completes, the test script confirms that the ticket/task has been repaired.
 
 
 The test should at least test corrections to the following types of brokeness:
 
 
 An Asana task is marked "create ticket," and a ticket exists within FogBugz with an equivalency link back to Asana, but the Asana task has no equivalency link to the FogBugz ticket.
 
 A FogBugz ticket is marked with "create ticket," and an Asana task exists with an equivalency link to FogBugz, but FogBugz ticket has no equivalency link to the Asana task.
 
 
 To test eventual consistency, the script should test the propagation of at least the following changes:
 
 
 User adds "create ticket" to an Asana task.  After Fogana script runs, a ticket should exist in FogBugz with identical name and description and the Asana task and FogBugz ticket should bidirectionally linked with equivalency hyperlinks.
 
 User adds "create ticket" to a FogButz ticket.  After Fogana script runs, a task should exist in Asana with identical name and description and the Asana task and FogBugz ticket should bidirectionally linked with equivalency hyperlnks.
 
 User modifies description of the Asana task.  After Fogana script runs, the description change propagates to the equivalent FogBugz ticket.
 
 User modifies description of the FogBugz ticket.  After Fogana script runs, the description change propagates to the equivalent Asana task.
 
 User modifies title of the Asana task ...
 
 User modifies title of the FogBugz ticket ...
 
 User reassigns the Asana task ...
 
 User reassigns the Fogbugz ticket ...

<p> We need a name for the script you are creating to sync FogBugz and Asana. For now I will call it &quot;Fogana.&quot;</p> <p> &quot;Idempotence&quot; means that if an operation is run multiple times and it succeeds at least once (i.e., twice, three times, etc.), the system ends up in the same state. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idempotent and search for &quot;Computer science meaning&quot;.</p> <p> &quot;Error correction&quot; refers to correcting errors that occur during transmission over a noisy channel (or performing operations on a system where partial failure may occur). http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Error_detection_and_correction</p> <p> &quot;Eventual consistency&quot; means that if the same query is made to an item (e.g., either the Asana task and its equivalent FogBugz task) that they will eventually return the same value. See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eventual_consistency</p> <p> &quot;Atomicity&quot; refers to a sequence of operations that either all occur or none do. &nbsp; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomicity_(database_systems)<br /> Updating both FogBugz and Asana <strong>cannot achieve &quot;atomicity&quot;. &nbsp;</strong>They cannot be atomic because a user may update one manually without updating the other. &nbsp;We want humans to update only one and Fogana will then propagate the changes. &nbsp;Furthermore, when Fogana adds a ticket to Asana and FogBugz, creation of one task/ticket must complete in order to get a hyperlink to put in the other. &nbsp;As a result Fogana cannot achieve atomic updates of FogBugz and Asana. &nbsp;In the absence of atomicity we accept that <strong>only</strong> <strong>eventual consistency is possible</strong>.</p> <p> Fogana should be <strong>idempotent</strong>, perform <strong>error correction</strong>, and achieve<strong> eventual consistency</strong>.</p> <p> A good way to test idempotence is to create a test script that repeats operations:</p> <ol> <li> Create ticket/task in Asana with the &quot;create ticket&quot; magic phrase.</li> <li> Run the Fogana script.</li> <li> Run the Fogana script again.</li> <li> confirm that exactly one equivalent task is created in FogBugz and is linked to Asana.</li> </ol> <p> Repeat the same thing for FogBugz to Asana.</p> <p> To test error correction, the test script should do the following:</p> <ol> <li> Creates ticket/task that is broken in some way.</li> <li> Run the Fogana script.</li> <li> Once the Fogana script completes, the test script confirms that the ticket/task has been repaired.</li> </ol> <p> The test should at least test corrections to the following types of brokeness:</p> <ol> <li> An Asana task is marked &quot;create ticket,&quot; and a ticket exists within FogBugz with an equivalency link back to Asana, but the Asana task has no equivalency link to the FogBugz ticket.</li> <li> A FogBugz ticket is marked with &quot;create ticket,&quot; and an Asana task exists with an equivalency link to FogBugz, but FogBugz ticket has no equivalency link to the Asana task.</li> </ol> <p> To test eventual consistency, the script should test the propagation of at least the following changes:</p> <ol> <li> User adds &quot;create ticket&quot; to an Asana task. &nbsp;After Fogana script runs, a ticket should exist in FogBugz with identical name and description and the Asana task and FogBugz ticket should bidirectionally linked with equivalency hyperlinks.</li> <li> User adds &quot;create ticket&quot; to a FogButz ticket. &nbsp;After Fogana script runs, a task should exist in Asana with identical name and description and the Asana task and FogBugz ticket should bidirectionally linked with equivalency hyperlnks.</li> <li> User modifies description of the Asana task. &nbsp;After Fogana script runs, the description change propagates to the equivalent FogBugz ticket.</li> <li> User modifies description of the FogBugz ticket. &nbsp;After Fogana script runs, the description change propagates to the equivalent Asana task.</li> <li> User modifies title of the Asana task ...</li> <li> User modifies title of the FogBugz ticket ...</li> <li> User reassigns the Asana task ...</li> <li> User reassigns the Fogbugz ticket ...</li> </ol> <p> &nbsp;</p>

OK, reproed the bug, checked that things are showing up in mongo, traced through the code paths. Most likely, from what I've seen so far, is that that special-casing for launchpad is resulting in launchpad being considered the *only* publisher/app for the purposes of the what-to-show-next logic. There's a bunch of places where is_launchpad causes the effective publisher/series/colleciton name/id/behavior to be launchpad's. Among those places, I think, is a dict representing the user's history for each publisher, whose items are iterated over to satisfy the "Returns one video from each of your most recently watched series/apps ordered by how recently you watched a video in that series" part of the spec. Based on the history of this bug, I'm next going to look at the commit history of mdb.services.category - I think the timing lines up for this to be a regression from some special-case changes for launchpad.

<![CDATA[
Asana copypasta. Description =========== The api is not handling the param 'index' which is preventing the ability to page through a list. When including 'index' in the arguments of a request the result length of the items array is always 0. To test load hotlist.samba.tv in a browser and enter the below in the console. var callback = function (e){console.log(e)}; var message = "category.get_category_items"; var args = {howmany: 10, category_id: "518091f02b5bc3bd4f863736", obj_id: "2037b930-4e76-11df-8480-123139023132", index: 10}; SocketAPI.makeRequest(message, args, callback); Adam Gomaa 2013-10-14 1150 ========================== @Todd Johnson What happens if index is not a multiple of howmany? Eg w/ 5 or 15. Also, is the behavior the same across different category types? There seems to be diff. code paths for popular/features/publisher/just4me, and though I think the bug is present in all of them, I think featured might have an additional off-by-one in doing block_size logic. Bigger picture - index-based pagination isn't how this should be impled. If the server-side collection is changed between the initial collection load and the 2nd request, the user can see duplicates and/or missing items, and the presence of dupes risks triggering edge-case bugs in the client-side code. But doing "next/prev page after/before item FOO" to allow for consistent-over-time result sets is a pretty big code change. Yesterday at 11:50am Adam Gomaa 2013-10-14 1642 ========================== Sending back to @Todd Johnson - I can't repro. I'm using this JS: http://git.flingo.tv/pb/view/eb5518b2 pasted into my console, and paging around/re-running the func, everywhere it works (in some cases call isn't working, I assume diff code path w/ diff parameters used client side in these cases) it's paginating correctly. Two possibilities - could have been a collection that just had 10 or fewer items, or it could be a publisher/series/collection combo that I haven't hit yet. Todd Johnson 2013-10-14 1749 ============================ I just synced prod and using TMZ was able to example I reproduced the issue. var params = {howmany: 20, category_id: "5180838d2b5bc3bd513066b1", obj_id: "2037b930-4e76-11df-8480-123139023132", index: 0} var message = "category.get_category_items"; var callback = function (e){console.log(e)}; SocketAPI.makeRequest(message, params, callback); Take note, with index 0 and howmany 20, 20 items are returned. Change howmany to 10 and set index to 10 and 0 items are returned.

This isn't urgent as everything with a cidclient that is currently using hotlist (sharp) uses port 8080, but this may not always be the case. Hotlist calls localhost:8080/device_info to get the device guid. The port number should be configurable as 8080 may not be available for all devices (Toshiba for example uses port 8081). The port number will be dependent on platform/model so any config/api call used should allow for a platform/model param.

see also case 95 As part of the image cleanup, we're introducing some new keys in collection and content item serialization. Currently, the value used for (for example) a publisher's box.jpg is a string like: http://flingo.tv/static/images/publishers/tmz/box.jpg Note that this is HTTP. But actual URL that the client-side ends up fetching is: https://img0.flingo.tv/image/crop?uri=http%3A%2F%2Fflingo.tv%2Fstatic%2Fimages%2Fpublishers%2Ftmz%2Fbox.jpg&w=418&h=418 For this issue: do we want any changes in this behavior? An alternative would be only include the significant part of the image URL ("images/publishers/tmz/box.jpg") and hit the cropping endpoint with a parameter that indicates it's relative to hotlist's static files root. Main goal here is to make the relevant code "aware" of hotlist static files.

 In that case, can you pull something like that for requests and use
 the data from the 1st and 2nd ad in the waterfall? e.g.
 
 Select distinct
 from_unixtime(event_timestamp,'%Y-%m-%d %H') hour, # time the event was tracked
 ifnull(partner,'no partner') partner, # name or id of the partner the
 ad was served for
 ad_unit, # name or id of the ad unit that the ad was served to
 country, # what country was the client IP in (assuming we have this data)
 'request', # what event was logged e.g. impression, start, etc.
 order1, # name or id of the order the line item was 1st in the waterfall
 line_item1, # name or id of the line item that was 1st in the waterfall
 creative1, # name or id of the creative that was 1st in the waterfall
 order2, # name or id of the order the line item was 2nd in the waterfall
 line_item2, # name or id of the line item that was 2nd in the waterfall
 creative2, # name or id of the creative that was 2nd in the waterfall
 count(*) count
 from tablename
 where event_timestamp between unix_timestamp('2013-12-06') and unix_timestamp()
 group by 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8

 In that case, can you pull something like that for requests and use
 the data from the 1st and 2nd ad in the waterfall? e.g.
 
 Select distinct
 from_unixtime(event_timestamp,'%Y-%m-%d %H') hour, # time the event was tracked
 ifnull(partner,'no partner') partner, # name or id of the partner the
 ad was served for
 ad_unit, # name or id of the ad unit that the ad was served to
 country, # what country was the client IP in (assuming we have this data)
 'request', # what event was logged e.g. impression, start, etc.
 order1, # name or id of the order the line item was 1st in the waterfall
 line_item1, # name or id of the line item that was 1st in the waterfall
 creative1, # name or id of the creative that was 1st in the waterfall
 order2, # name or id of the order the line item was 2nd in the waterfall
 line_item2, # name or id of the line item that was 2nd in the waterfall
 creative2, # name or id of the creative that was 2nd in the waterfall
 count(*) count
 from tablename
 where event_timestamp between unix_timestamp('2013-12-06') and unix_timestamp()
 group by 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8

see case 58 and case 36. This is a ticket specifically for being able to access mongodb for in a testcase. The actual data fixtures are out-of-scope here - most likely this'll just be encompassed in installing mongodb onto the build nodes and then having a job-number-based format string for specifying the database names. The next step will be to have something to populate "test$JOBNUMBER-contentdb", "-appdb", and so on from a TBD source, then set that up for use in the test suite. Note that this only gives us a dataset to test against, but as a side-effect, will violate per-test isolation. But once we can easily spin up a dataset-per-jenkins-job, finding a way of resetting to the start state of the test fixures after each test is a simpler step.

It's a big diff. https://samba-tv.kilnhg.com/Code/Repositories/main/gs/History/mainline/adamg-develop It includes a lot of significant changes - hotlist fixes for just4me, impl of appcache manifest serving, OTF fonts saved as .svg. Also has a high-impact, untested change, adding the web role to the flingos for the appcache manifest, which could very easily break things that previously fell through to API endpoints but will now hit try_files. That being said, getting this merged is a hard prereq for starting to write up some development docs.

Subject: Re: FogBugz (Case 261) Infrastructure - Get adamg-develop into mainline

Sort of - I've gone over what QA can be done with Tapan, it's currently on my dev instance and should be pushable to any of the dev domains:
 
 http://adamg.hotlist.samba.tv/#featured
 
 However, all dev instances differ from the prod setup in that they always have both appserv and web roles (among many others), so the static files used by hotlist are always accessible to appserv, which is used to generate an up-to-date version for the appcache manifest file. In prod, servers that handle appserv requests (flingo0, flingo1, flingo2) don't have local copies of hotlist's static files as of now - they're served directly from the reverse-proxy server (router2).
 
 The main part that I'm worried about breakage-wise is the change to address that issue. Just based on my reading of the code & poking around the prod servers, I added the web roles to the flingos, which, AFAICT, should be all that's needed for the flingos to get local copies of hotlist's files. But that's the part that can't really be QAed on dev instances: it worked fine on my dev instance before I made the change, but would have definitely failed in prod.

<![CDATA[
Sort of - I've gone over what QA can be done with Tapan, it's currently on my dev instance and should be pushable to any of the dev domains:<br /> <br /> http://adamg.hotlist.samba.tv/#featured<br /> <br /> However, all dev instances differ from the prod setup in that they always have both appserv and web roles (among many others), so the static files used by hotlist are always accessible to appserv, which is used to generate an up-to-date version for the appcache manifest file. In prod, servers that handle appserv requests (flingo0, flingo1, flingo2) don't have local copies of hotlist's static files as of now - they're served directly from the reverse-proxy server (router2).<br /> <br /> The main part that I'm worried about breakage-wise is the change to address that issue. Just based on my reading of the code &amp; poking around the prod servers, I added the web roles to the flingos, which, AFAICT, should be all that's needed for the flingos to get local copies of hotlist's files. But that's the part that can't really be QAed on dev instances: it worked fine on my dev instance before I made the change, but would have definitely failed in prod.<br /> <br /> -- <br /> Samba TV Cases<br /> cases@samba-tv.fogbugz.com<br /> ---------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /> Powered by FogBugz from Fog Creek Software. http://www.fogcreek.com/fogbugz<br /> <br /> <br /> -----Original Message-----<br /> From: &quot;Chris Jantz-Sell&quot; &lt;chris@samba.tv&gt;<br /> Reply-To: &quot;Chris Jantz-Sell&quot; &lt;chris@samba.tv&gt;<br /> Date: Mon, 2 Dec 2013 17:36:40 -0800<br /> To: &quot;samba-tv fogbugz&quot; &lt;cases@samba-tv.fogbugz.com&gt;<br /> Subject: Re: FogBugz (Case 261) Infrastructure - Get adamg-develop into mainline<br /> <br /> &gt;Can we get this QA'd fully tonight so we are ready to push in the AM w/o<br /> &gt;needing any additional QA?<br /> &gt;<br /> &gt;On Mon, Dec 2, 2013 at 5:24 PM, samba-tv fogbugz &lt;cases@samba-tv.fogbugz.com<br /> &gt;&gt; wrote:<br /> &gt;<br /> &gt;&gt;&nbsp; [image: avatar]<br /> &gt;&gt; *Adam Gomaa* notified you on *Case 261*: Get adamg-develop into mainline&lt;https://samba-tv.fogbugz.com/f/cases/261&gt;:<br /> &gt;&gt;<br /> &gt;&gt;&nbsp; *Feature* in [image: Project:] Infrastructure: Dev Tooling<br /> &gt;&gt;&nbsp; OK - pushing this until tomorrow, it's late for a<br /> &gt;&gt; potential-breakage deploy.<br /> &gt;&gt;<br /> &gt;&gt; I'd like to do this first thing tomorrow AM, but timing w/ spotlight and<br /> &gt;&gt; mobile web SDK meetings might push it to midday, we'll see.<br /> &gt;&gt;<br /> &gt;&gt; related to deploying:<br /> &gt;&gt;<br /> &gt;&gt; case 254 for appcache manifest headers<br /> &gt;&gt; case 36 for saving set_position to user history<br /> &gt;&gt; case 112 for correctly interpreting saved user history<br /> &gt;&gt;&nbsp; *Due* changed:<br /> &gt;&gt; None&nbsp; [image: changed to]&nbsp; 12/3/2013 2:00 PM (GMT-08:00)<br /> &gt;&gt;<br /> &gt;&gt;&nbsp; [image: Priority]&nbsp; *Priority*: 3 – Must fix&nbsp; [image: Status]&nbsp; *Status*:<br /> &gt;&gt; Active&nbsp; [image: Assigned To]&nbsp; *Assigned to*: Adam Gomaa&nbsp; [image:<br /> &gt;&gt; Milestone]&nbsp; *Milestone*: Undecided<br /> &gt;&gt;<br /> &gt;&gt; Go to Case<br /> &gt;&gt;&nbsp; &lt;https://samba-tv.fogbugz.com/f/cases/261&gt;<br /> &gt;&gt; Don't want FogBugz notifications anymore?

http://docs.celeryproject.org/en/latest/whatsnew-3.1.html I've had mixed experiences with celery in the past.

Not as hard-and-fast as the other rules, but visibility is important. Do whatever is needed to be able to monitor ongoing tasks, keep logs of all tasks, have some way of doing analysis on stuff like number of tasks executions, total CPU/network used by tasks, so on.

Hopefully this is helpful tho:<br /> <br /> http://attentionshard.wordpress.com/2013/10/25/os-x-mavericks-fixing-broken-python-development-environments/<br /> <br /> Then, download the attached reqs-push-OSX-10.9-Mavericks.txt (also under tools/adamg/, at least for now) and run ~/path/to/virtualenv/bin/pip install -r ~/path/to/reqs-push-OSX-10.9-Mavericks.txt.<br /> <br /> You can now push with PYTHONPATH=. ~/path/to/virtualenv/bin/python ./push/push.py yoursub.flingo.tv

Related: case 125 case 58 case 41 case 117 case 121 Acceptance: - jenkins job - boots EC2 instance - clone gs repo from kiln - sets up mongo data from ??? - runs hotlist from virtualenv on high port (8180 or similar) - listens on port 80 Note that having the media on the filesystem is *not* encompassed - the generated URLs are still going to point to ???.flingo.tv/image?url=http://flingo.tv. The local-filesystem images will be needed for running appserv in the cloud though, so it'll likely get rolled into that step. Plus there's pending changes in image url generation logic, gonna wait for those to happen first.

rsyslog docs are probably the worst in the world. Ever. I've never been able to find docs for old versions, the man page seems to be for 3.something, and the online docs are for the current release, which is 7.whocares, and it's always 5.??? that rsyslogd -v shows. Aaaanyway. http://www.rsyslog.com/doc/imuxsock.html > Unix log sockets can be flow-controlled. That is, if processing queues fill up, the unix socket reader is blocked for a short while. This may be useful to prevent overruning the queues (which may cause excessive disk-io where it actually would not be needed). However, flow-controlling a log socket (and especially the system log socket) can lead to a very unresponsive system. As such, flow control is disabled by default. That means any log records are places as quickly as possible into the processing queues. okay, so if "as quickly as possible" isn't fast enough, and the processing queues *do* fill up, then what? do writes to the socket block? In the syslog, there's a ton of duplicate message drops and rate-limiting messages. A gem from the docs: > Caveats/Known Bugs: [...] * This documentation is sparse and incomplete. Not. even. funny.

/http/ngx_http_upstream_module.html#server > max_fails=number sets the number of unsuccessful attempts to communicate with the server that should happen in the duration set by the fail_timeout parameter to consider the server unavailable for a duration also set by the fail_timeout parameter. By default, the number of unsuccessful attempts is set to 1. The zero value disables the accounting of attempts. What is considered an unsuccessful attempt is defined by the proxy_next_upstream, fastcgi_next_upstream, and memcached_next_upstream directives. Our config is max_fails=3, fail_timeout=5. http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_proxy_module.html#proxy_next_upstream > default: proxy_next_upstream error timeout; Followed by, in 12 places in our nginx conf (I really *really* wish I was joking), none of them near the max_fails or fail_timeout directives: > proxy_read_timeout 900s; I'm not sure if this proxy_read_timeout is what is used for what proxy_next_upstream considers a timeout, but I don't see any other obvious options that it might be using. (nginx docs are another bane of my existence.) I gotta say, this *really* bothers me. Lets walk through this. Appserv hangs. nginx hits one of the flingos, and waits for up to 900s - 15 minutes - for the request to timeout, because we're doing long-polling XHR instead of configuring websockets correctly (or, crazy talk, using any one of N other ways of doing pubsub/event notification that don't involve port 80 on our servers at all). Finally times out, goes to the next flingo and does the same - only in prod, of course, because in dev, there's only one upstream. It's really easy to get 502s when pushing to dev, I get it all the time. But on prod - and *only* on prod, where there's more than one slowroll_command target for restarting appserv, meaning there's another server available on :6543 to fall through to instead of 502ing as in dev - it'll merrily hang for 15m before considering the request a failure, at which point 3 timeouts have to happen in a 5-second window before it'll take that upstream out. And 5s later it's back in, for another 15 minutes. (and yes, straight-up errors would cause the upstream to go out of the rotation quicker, as happens when pushing to dev instances, but still only for 5 seconds. And this likely *did* happen as file descriptors got exhausted on the flingos, at the same point that we got the the 2k exceptions from cacheserv stuff becoming None. This is just further damning.) And this enormously dangerous, self-ddosing failure mode is NOWHERE in our source tree, because the file that's versioned has a single, innocent, commented out 127.0.0.1 upstream. And it's nowhere on our dev instances, because when pushed to dev, the upstream body becomes a totally sane-looking, sensible, mirror image of the comment. % ssh adamg.flingo.tv grep -m 1 'upstream\ api' -A 3 /opt/nginx/conf/nginx.conf upstream api { # server 127.0.0.1:6543 max_fails=3 fail_timeout=5s; server 127.0.0.1:6543 max_fails=3 fail_timeout=5s; } But on prod, after N levels of indirection, we get: akg@tango[samba][pts/23,4] ~/srv/samba/gs 2013-12-03T21:38:33-0800 4869 -> 0 % ssh router2.samba grep -m 1 'upstream\ api' -A 5 /opt/nginx/conf/nginx.conf upstream api { # server 127.0.0.1:6543 max_fails=3 fail_timeout=5s; server 10.1.0.10:6543 max_fails=3 fail_timeout=5s; server 10.1.0.11:6543 max_fails=3 fail_timeout=5s; server 10.1.0.12:6543 max_fails=3 fail_timeout=5s; } This isn't the place for discussions, so I'm not going to rehash how we start addressing this for the Nth time. But it is important to recognize that *all* we had here was a slowdown in *some* endpoints. It happens, and will continue to happen, and cannot result in a firedrill if we expect to get into the habit of shipping regularly. This should have been nothing more than a minor blip for as long as it took to rollout a fix. But *being clever* with our infrastructure turned this into 40+ minutes of downtime while our rev-proxy pegged the app servers to the point of exhausting available file descriptors, causing unrelated exceptions in... well, anything that uses sockets - and exacerbating the original regression. $ grep '\[04/Dec/2013' ~/var/samba/nginx-access-131203.log | sed -e 's/.*\[//' -e 's/\].*//' | grep Dec | cut -c 1-16 | uniq -c 129947 04/Dec/2013:00:0 130480 04/Dec/2013:00:1 132064 04/Dec/2013:00:2 132069 04/Dec/2013:00:3 137619 04/Dec/2013:00:4 147937 04/Dec/2013:00:5 146554 04/Dec/2013:01:0 148435 04/Dec/2013:01:1 153848 04/Dec/2013:01:2 363674 04/Dec/2013:01:3 351250 04/Dec/2013:01:4 347149 04/Dec/2013:01:5 310177 04/Dec/2013:02:0 261279 04/Dec/2013:02:1 146916 04/Dec/2013:02:2 67395 04/Dec/2013:02:3 As things stand now, it's unreasonable to expect us to anticipate or avoid issues like this. These kinds of cascading failures will continue to happen until and unless we start taking our codebase seriously. Okay. Done venting.

And it's nowhere on our dev instances, because when pushed to dev, the upstream body becomes a totally sane-looking, sensible, mirror image of the comment.<br /> <br /> % ssh adamg.flingo.tv grep -m 1 'upstream\ api' -A 3 /opt/nginx/conf/nginx.conf&nbsp; <br /> &nbsp; &nbsp; upstream api {<br /> #&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; server 127.0.0.1:6543 max_fails=3 fail_timeout=5s;<br /> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; server 127.0.0.1:6543 max_fails=3 fail_timeout=5s;<br /> &nbsp; &nbsp; }<br /> <br /> But on prod, after N levels of indirection, we get:<br /> <br /> akg@tango[samba][pts/23,4] ~/srv/samba/gs 2013-12-03T21:38:33-0800 4869 -&gt; 0<br /> % ssh router2.samba grep -m 1 'upstream\ api' -A 5 /opt/nginx/conf/nginx.conf&nbsp; <br /> &nbsp; &nbsp; upstream api {<br /> #&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; server 127.0.0.1:6543 max_fails=3 fail_timeout=5s;<br /> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; server 10.1.0.10:6543 max_fails=3 fail_timeout=5s;<br /> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; server 10.1.0.11:6543 max_fails=3 fail_timeout=5s;<br /> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; server 10.1.0.12:6543 max_fails=3 fail_timeout=5s;<br /> &nbsp; &nbsp; }<br /> <br /> This isn't the place for discussions, so I'm not going to rehash how we start addressing this for the Nth time. But it is important to recognize that *all* we had here was a slowdown in *some* endpoints. It happens, and will continue to happen, and cannot result in a firedrill if we expect to get into the habit of shipping regularly.<br /> <br /> This should have been nothing more than a minor blip for as long as it took to rollout a fix. But *being clever* with our infrastructure turned this into 40+ minutes of downtime while our rev-proxy pegged the app servers to the point of exhausting available file descriptors, causing unrelated exceptions in... well, anything that uses sockets - and exacerbating the original regression.<br /> <br /> $ grep '\[04/Dec/2013' ~/var/samba/nginx-access-131203.log | sed -e 's/.*\[//' -e 's/\].*//' | grep Dec | cut -c 1-16 | uniq -c <br /> &nbsp;129947 04/Dec/2013:00:0<br /> &nbsp;130480 04/Dec/2013:00:1<br /> &nbsp;132064 04/Dec/2013:00:2<br /> &nbsp;132069 04/Dec/2013:00:3<br /> &nbsp;137619 04/Dec/2013:00:4<br /> &nbsp;147937 04/Dec/2013:00:5<br /> &nbsp;146554 04/Dec/2013:01:0<br /> &nbsp;148435 04/Dec/2013:01:1<br /> &nbsp;153848 04/Dec/2013:01:2<br /> &nbsp;363674 04/Dec/2013:01:3<br /> &nbsp;351250 04/Dec/2013:01:4<br /> &nbsp;347149 04/Dec/2013:01:5<br /> &nbsp;310177 04/Dec/2013:02:0<br /> &nbsp;261279 04/Dec/2013:02:1<br /> &nbsp;146916 04/Dec/2013:02:2<br /> &nbsp; 67395 04/Dec/2013:02:3<br /> <br /> As things stand now, it's unreasonable to expect us to anticipate or avoid issues like this. These kinds of cascading failures will continue to happen until and unless we start taking our codebase seriously.<br /> <br /> Okay. Done venting.

So, I think I found the issue in appserv code that was causing much more load than needed.  The sysloghandler was being added to event_log on every construction of the cid view object.  I made the change below to make sure it only gets added once.  Now, on my instance with ~150 log requests per second rsyslogd CPU usage is still 1-2%.

 Subject: Media Kit submission form needs a confirmation screen
 To: Flingo <sf@flingo.tv>
 
 
 When requesting the media kit from samba.tv it is not clear the form was
 submitted or what will happen next. We should add a confirmation screen
 stating the request was sent and we will get back to them shortly. When I
 submitted the form I expected a sdk to begin downloading. I have noticed
 from inbounds that some users have submitted the form multiple times which
 is probably due to the issue stated above.

 Friday, 22 November 2013 [image: Blank space] *[ACTION REQUIRED] Ruby
 Security Vulnerability; CVE-2013-4164*
 
 Hello,
 
 You are receiving this email because you run at least one Ruby (MRI)
 application on Heroku.
 
 Early this morning, the Ruby project announced a security vulnerability in
 MRI 1.8.7, 1.9.2, 1.9.3,
 2.0.0<http://lists.heroku.com/t/r-l-nhithht-tjdyttclh-d/>.
 The CVE identifier is CVE-2013-4164. Rubinius and JRuby are unaffected.
 
 We believe this is limited to a denial of service
 vulnerability<http://lists.heroku.com/t/r-l-nhithht-tjdyttclh-h/>.
 Any Ruby application that parses JSON from an untrusted source can
 potentially be made to crash with little difficulty. There is also a slim
 theoretical possibility of a much more serious vulnerability, an Arbitrary
 Code Execution <http://lists.heroku.com/t/r-l-nhithht-tjdyttclh-n/>. We
 would like to stress that there are no known Proofs of Concept and this is
 purely theoretical, but can not be ruled out.
 
 In response, we have released Ruby 1.8.7p375, 1.9.2p321, 1.9.3p484 and
 2.0.0p353 which closes this attack vulnerability. Please upgrade as soon as
 possible. These releases are only available on our Cedar stack. If your
 application is on our Bamboo stack, please see the note below.
 
 Additionally, the Ruby project has previously announced support for the
 1.8.7 branch has been discontinued, and has de-facto discontinued support
 for 1.9.2. As such, 1.8.7p375 and 1.9.2p321 are not official release
 numbers from them, but what we’re using to indicate the presence of the
 patch. We strongly urge all pre-1.9.3 users to begin migration plans to
 1.9.3 or 2.0.0 at their earliest convenience, as we can not guarantee our
 ability to backport security patches indefinitely.
 
 *Detecting if you’re vulnerable*
 
 $ heroku run "ruby -v" -a APPNAME
 
 If your patch version is less than what’s listed above (e.g., 1.9.2p320),
 you’re vulnerable.
 
 *Upgrading*
 
 To upgrade, you’ll need to push a new commit to your app, which will cause
 a deploy. If you don’t want to push any actual changes, this commit can be
 empty:
 
 $ git commit --allow-empty -m "upgrade ruby version"
 $ git push heroku master
 
 In the push output you should see the new version being picked up. You
 should see something like one of the following, depending on the version of
 Ruby:
 
 New: ruby 1.8.7p375 (2013-11-22 revision 375) [x86_64-linux]
 New: ruby 1.9.2p321 (2013-11-22 revision 321) [x86_64-linux]
 New: ruby 1.9.3p484 (2013-11-22 revision 43786) [x86_64-linux]
 New: ruby 2.0.0p353 (2013-11-22 revision 43784) [x86_64-linux]
 
 Users of forked versions of the Ruby buildpack should be sure to pull in
 the most recent changes.
 
 *Verifying that you are running a fixed version of Ruby*
 
 You can also verify that the runtime is installed by running:
 
 $ heroku run "ruby -v" -a MYAPPNAME
 
 This will show one of the version strings above (e.g. ruby 1.9.3p484
 (2013-11-22 revision 43786) [x86_64-linux], or 2.0.0p353 (2013-11-22
 revision 43784) [x86_64-linux], etc.)
 
 *Note for Bamboo users*
 
 For Bamboo applications, all operating system libraries are based on Debian
 5.0. Support for this version, including security updates,
 was discontinued by the Debian project in February 2011. Given
 the obsolescence of the underlying libraries, we have made the
 difficult decision to *NOT* release a patch for today’s vulnerability
 for Bamboo. All Bamboo users are strongly urged to begin migrating
 your application to
 Cedar<http://lists.heroku.com/t/r-l-nhithht-tjdyttclh-p/> as
 soon as possible.
 
 If you have any questions, please contact
 us<http://lists.heroku.com/t/r-l-nhithht-tjdyttclh-x/>

There is also a slim<br /> theoretical possibility of a much more serious vulnerability, an Arbitrary<br /> Code Execution &lt;http://lists.heroku.com/t/r-l-nhithht-tjdyttclh-n/&gt;. We<br /> would like to stress that there are no known Proofs of Concept and this is<br /> purely theoretical, but can not be ruled out.<br /> <br /> In response, we have released Ruby 1.8.7p375, 1.9.2p321, 1.9.3p484 and<br /> 2.0.0p353 which closes this attack vulnerability. Please upgrade as soon as<br /> possible.&nbsp; These releases are only available on our Cedar stack.&nbsp; If your<br /> application is on our Bamboo stack, please see the note below.<br /> <br /> Additionally, the Ruby project has previously announced support for the<br /> 1.8.7 branch has been discontinued, and has de-facto discontinued support<br /> for 1.9.2.&nbsp; As such, 1.8.7p375 and 1.9.2p321 are not official release<br /> numbers from them, but what we’re using to indicate the presence of the<br /> patch.&nbsp; We strongly urge all pre-1.9.3 users to begin migration plans to<br /> 1.9.3 or 2.0.0 at their earliest convenience, as we can not guarantee our<br /> ability to backport security patches indefinitely.<br /> <br /> *Detecting if you’re vulnerable*<br /> <br /> $ heroku run &quot;ruby -v&quot; -a APPNAME<br /> <br /> If your patch version is less than what’s listed above (e.g., 1.9.2p320),<br /> you’re vulnerable.<br /> <br /> *Upgrading*<br /> <br /> To upgrade, you’ll need to push a new commit to your app, which will cause<br /> a deploy. If you don’t want to push any actual changes, this commit can be<br /> empty:<br /> <br /> $ git commit --allow-empty -m &quot;upgrade ruby version&quot;<br /> $ git push heroku master<br /> <br /> In the push output you should see the new version being picked up. You<br /> should see something like one of the following, depending on the version of<br /> Ruby:<br /> <br /> New: ruby 1.8.7p375 (2013-11-22 revision 375) [x86_64-linux]<br /> New: ruby 1.9.2p321 (2013-11-22 revision 321) [x86_64-linux]<br /> New: ruby 1.9.3p484 (2013-11-22 revision 43786) [x86_64-linux]<br /> New: ruby 2.0.0p353 (2013-11-22 revision 43784) [x86_64-linux]<br /> <br /> Users of forked versions of the Ruby buildpack should be sure to pull in<br /> the most recent changes.<br /> <br /> *Verifying that you are running a fixed version of Ruby*<br /> <br /> You can also verify that the runtime is installed by running:<br /> <br /> $ heroku run &quot;ruby -v&quot; -a MYAPPNAME<br /> <br /> This will show one of the version strings above (e.g. ruby 1.9.3p484<br /> (2013-11-22 revision 43786) [x86_64-linux], or 2.0.0p353 (2013-11-22<br /> revision 43784) [x86_64-linux], etc.)<br /> <br /> *Note for Bamboo users*<br /> <br /> For Bamboo applications, all operating system libraries are based on Debian<br /> 5.0.&nbsp; Support for this version, including security updates,<br /> was discontinued by the Debian project in February 2011.&nbsp; Given<br /> the obsolescence of the underlying libraries, we have made the<br /> difficult decision to *NOT* release a patch for today’s vulnerability<br /> for Bamboo.&nbsp; All Bamboo users are strongly urged to begin migrating<br /> your application to<br /> Cedar&lt;http://lists.heroku.com/t/r-l-nhithht-tjdyttclh-p/&gt; as<br /> soon as possible.<br /> <br /> If you have any questions, please contact<br /> us&lt;http://lists.heroku.com/t/r-l-nhithht-tjdyttclh-x/&gt;<br /> .<br /> <br /> Terence Lee, Heroku Ruby Team<br /> Tom Maher, Heroku Security Team<br /> &nbsp; [image: Blank space]<br /> <br /> <br /> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; View on web<br /> &lt;http://lists.heroku.com/t/r-e-nhithht-tjdyttclh-r/&gt; |&nbsp; Send<br /> to a friend&lt;http://heroku.forwardtomyfriend.com/r-tjdyttclh-5F9B513A-nhithht-l-y&gt;<br /> |<br /> Email Settings&lt;http://heroku.updatemyprofile.com/r-nhithht-5F9B513A-tjdyttclh-j&gt;<br /> |<br /> Unsubscribe &lt;http://lists.heroku.com/t/r-u-nhithht-tjdyttclh-t/&gt;<br /> &nbsp; [image: Follow us on<br /> Twitter]&lt;http://lists.heroku.com/t/r-l-nhithht-tjdyttclh-m/&gt; [image:<br /> Watch on Vimeo] &lt;http://lists.heroku.com/t/r-l-nhithht-tjdyttclh-c/&gt;<br />

This was never in mainline and/or master, so wasn't part of the spotlight-api branch when it was split off. Copy in setup.py, MANIFEST.in, some other stuff, munge to include spotlight stuff. This is kind of a problem... the deployment tooling right now is only around gs, and is part of gs' repo. Not sure whether it should be deployed from the gs jobbing command (== reliance on other respos == bad) or from spotlight-backend's copy (== duplicate infrastructure code paths, == bad.)
